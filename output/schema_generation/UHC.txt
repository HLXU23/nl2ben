====================
Human: 
As a database engineer, design schema for a database called UHC.
Requirements:
The database is used for health care domain.
The database is used for university health center, collecting data of patients, doctors, etc.
Contains at least 5 tables.
Contains at least 50 columns in total.
Contains table patients(description: information of patients).
Table patients contains at least 20 columns.
Table patients contains column age(description: age of patients).
Contains table doctors.


For tables, give name and description in format:
{Table_name}: {Table_description}

For columns, give name, type and description in format:
({Column_type}){Column_name}: {Column_description}
Optional column types: 
BOOLEAN: Column with boolean values (True / False) E.g. Active status
CHAR: Column with fixed-length string values E.g. Phone number
VARCHAR: Column with variable-length string values E.g. Name, Email address
INT: Column with integer values in specific range. E.g. Age 
REAL: Column with float values in specific range. E.g. Income, Price
TEXT: Column with text values E.g. Instructions, Reasons, Descriptions
DATE: Column with values in format: YYYY-MM-DD
TIME: Column with values in format: HH:MM:SS
TIMESTAMP: Column with values in format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

For primary keys, column name should be followed by *
For foreign keys, referencing column should be followed by ({referenced table}.{referenced column})
When one column is primary key and foreign key at the same time, () should be followed by *, so * should always be followed by :

Output format (NO EXPLANATION! NO ANY OTHER OUTPUT!):

{Table1_name}: {Table1_description}
-({Column1.1_type}){Column1.1_name}*: {Column1.1_description}
-({Column1.2_type}){Column1.2_name}({Table2_name}.{Column2.1_name}): {Column1.2_description}

{Table2_name}: {Table2_description}
-({Column2.1_type}){Column2.1_name}*: {Column2.1_description}
-({Column2.2_type}){Column2.2_name}: {Column2.2_description}
