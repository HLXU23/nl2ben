When one column is primary key and foreign key at the same time, () should be followed by *, so * should always be followed by :

Output format (NO EXPLANATION! NO ANY OTHER OUTPUT!):

{Table1_name}: {Table1_description}
-({Column1.1_type}){Column1.1_name}*: {Column1.1_description}
-({Column1.2_type}){Column1.2_name}({Table2_name}.{Column2.1_name}): {Column1.2_description}

{Table2_name}: {Table2_description}
-({Column2.1_type}){Column2.1_name}*: {Column2.1_description}
-({Column2.2_type}){Column2.2_name}: {Column2.2_description}
