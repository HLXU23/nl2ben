As a data scientist, generate 10 rows data with given schema. Make data as realistic as possible.

CREATE TABLE medical_records (
    record_id INT,
    patient_id INT,
    doctor_id INT,
    record_date DATETIME,
    diagnosis TEXT,
    treatment TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (record_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors (doctor_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients (patient_id)
);

doctors.doctor_id: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
patients.patient_id: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
