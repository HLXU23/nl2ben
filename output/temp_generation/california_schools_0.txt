As a professor teaching database courses, generate 5 question templates with corresponding SQL answer templates for examination.

Requirements of question templates:

1, As realistic as possible

2, Evidence must be used when students answer the questions. In the other words, questions should be unsolvable without evidence information.

3, Use `` around table / column names to prevent reserved word conflicts

4, (Optional) You can use `{TABLE}` to indicate any tables, `{COLUMN}` to indicate any columns.
For example, you can have 'find all entries of {COLUMN} from table {TABLE}.' in question and 'SELECT `{COLUMN}` FROM `{TABLE}`' in SQL answer.
If you want to use this, ensure that any table / column can be placed in the designated location and does not affect the plausibility of the question

5, (Optional) You can use {table_name.column_name} to indicate an arbitrary value in this column. 
For example, suggest there is a column student_id in table student. 
When you want to have 'student with id A0001' in question, use 'student with id {student.student_id}'
When you want to have 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == A0001' in SQL answer, use 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == {student.student_id}'

Evidence you should use:
Eligible free rate for K-12 = `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`

...====================1
Q: Find the average percentage of students eligible for free meals in schools located in `{County Name}` for the academic year `{Academic Year}`.
E: Eligible free rate for K-12 = `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`
A: 
```sql
SELECT AVG(`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`) AS avg_free_meal_rate
FROM `frpm`
WHERE `County Name` = '{County Name}' AND `Academic Year` = '{Academic Year}';
```

2
Q: List the names of schools in `{District Name}` that have an average SAT math score above `{AvgScrMath}` for the year `{Academic Year}`.
E: Average SAT math score is provided in the `satscores` table.
A: 
```sql
SELECT s.`School Name`
FROM `satscores` AS sat
JOIN `schools` AS s ON sat.`cds` = s.`CDSCode`
JOIN `frpm` AS f ON s.`CDSCode` = f.`CDSCode`
WHERE f.`District Name` = '{District Name}' AND sat.`AvgScrMath` > {AvgScrMath} AND f.`Academic Year` = '{Academic Year}';
```

3
Q: Calculate the total enrollment of students in grades K-12 across all schools in `{County Name}` for the academic year `{Academic Year}`.
E: Total enrollment is provided in the `frpm` table.
A: 
```sql

```

4
Q: Identify the top 5 schools with the highest percentage of students eligible for FRPM (K-12) in `{County Name}` for the academic year `{Academic Year}`.
E: Percentage eligible for FRPM (K-12) is provided in the `frpm` table.
A: 
```sql
SELECT `School Name`, `Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)`
FROM `frpm`
WHERE `County Name` = '{County Name}' AND `Academic Year` = '{Academic Year}'
ORDER BY `Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)` DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Q: Find the average SAT reading score for schools in `{District Name}` that have a charter school status of `{Charter School (Y/N)}` for the academic year `{Academic Year}`.
E: Average SAT reading score is provided in the `satscores` table.
A: 
```sql
SELECT AVG(sat.`AvgScrRead`) AS avg_sat_reading_score
