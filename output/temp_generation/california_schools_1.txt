As a professor teaching database courses, generate 5 question templates with corresponding SQL answer templates for examination.

Requirements of question templates:

1, As realistic as possible

2, Evidence must be used when students answer the questions. In the other words, questions should be unsolvable without evidence information.

3, Use `` around table / column names to prevent reserved word conflicts

4, (Optional) You can use `{TABLE}` to indicate any tables, `{COLUMN}` to indicate any columns.
For example, you can have 'find all entries of {COLUMN} from table {TABLE}.' in question and 'SELECT `{COLUMN}` FROM `{TABLE}`' in SQL answer.
If you want to use this, ensure that any table / column can be placed in the designated location and does not affect the plausibility of the question

5, (Optional) You can use {table_name.column_name} to indicate an arbitrary value in this column. 
For example, suggest there is a column student_id in table student. 
When you want to have 'student with id A0001' in question, use 'student with id {student.student_id}'
When you want to have 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == A0001' in SQL answer, use 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == {student.student_id}'

Evidence you should use:
Eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`

Output format (NO ANY OTHER OUTPUT):
1
Q: {Question template}
E: {Evidence}
A: 
```sql
{SQL answer template(executable)}
```

2
Q: {Question template}
E: {Evidence}
A: 
```sql
{SQL answer template(executable)}
```
...====================1
Q: Find the average percentage of students eligible for free meals among all schools in the county with the name '{frpm.County Name}'.
E: Eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`
A: 
```sql
SELECT AVG(`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS avg_free_meal_rate
FROM `frpm`
WHERE `County Name` = '{frpm.County Name}';
```

2
Q: List the names of schools in the district '{frpm.District Name}' where the percentage of students eligible for free meals is above the district average.
E: Eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`
A: 
```sql
WITH DistrictAverage AS (
    SELECT `District Name`, AVG(`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS avg_free_meal_rate
    FROM `frpm`
    GROUP BY `District Name`
)
SELECT f.`School Name`
FROM `frpm` f
JOIN DistrictAverage da ON f.`District Name` = da.`District Name`
WHERE f.`Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / f.`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > da.avg_free_meal_rate
AND f.`District Name` = '{frpm.District Name}';
```

3
Q: Retrieve the CDSCode and school name of the school with the highest SAT average score in reading.
E: The average SAT score in reading is stored in the `AvgScrRead` column of the `satscores` table.
A: 
```sql
SELECT `cds`, `sname`
FROM `satscores`
ORDER BY `AvgScrRead` DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

4
Q: Find the total number of students enrolled in schools that are charter schools and have a percentage of students eligible for free meals above 50%.
E: Charter schools are indicated by the `Charter School (Y/N)` column in the `frpm` table, and eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`.
A: 
```sql
SELECT SUM(`Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`) AS total_enrollment
FROM `frpm`
WHERE `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1
AND `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0.5;
```

5
Q: List the names and district names of schools that have an average SAT math score above 600 and are located in the county '{schools.County}'.
E: The average SAT math score is stored in the `AvgScrMath` column of the `satscores` table, and the county name is stored in the `County` column of the `schools` table.
A: 
```sql
SELECT s.`School`, s.`District`
FROM `schools` s
JOIN `satscores` ss ON s.`CDSCode` = ss.`cds`
WHERE ss.`AvgScrMath` > 600
AND s.`County` = '{schools.County}';
```
