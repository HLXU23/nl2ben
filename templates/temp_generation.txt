As a data expert, you need to design a set of written test questions for your company's database and test the candidates' database knowledge and expertise in related fields. In this test, you want to test the candidate's understanding of the following concepts:
{EVIDENCE}

{SCHEMA}

Requirements:

1, Questions should be likely to asked by database users in real-world situations

2, Evidence MUST be used when students answer the questions. In the other words, questions should be unsolvable without evidence information.

3, Use `` around table / column names to prevent reserved word conflicts

4, (Optional) You can use {table_name.column_name} to indicate an arbitrary value in this column. 
For example, suggest there is a column student_id in table student. 
When you want to have 'student with id A0001' in question, use 'student with id {student.student_id}'
When you want to have 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == A0001' in SQL answer, use 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == {student.student_id}'

Output format (NO ANY OTHER OUTPUT):
1
Q: {Question template}
A: 
```
{SQL answer template(executable)}
```

2
Q: {Question template}
A: 
```
{SQL answer template(executable)}
```
...

Now, your turn to generate {TEMP_NUM} questions about given concepts.
