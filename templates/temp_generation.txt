As a professor teaching database courses, generate {TEMP_NUM} question templates with corresponding SQL answer templates for examination.

Requirements of question templates:

1, As realistic as possible

2, Evidence must be used when students answer the questions. In the other words, questions should be unsolvable without evidence information.

3, Use `` around table / column names to prevent reserved word conflicts

4, (Optional) You can use `{TABLE}` to indicate any tables, `{COLUMN}` to indicate any columns.
For example, you can have 'find all entries of {COLUMN} from table {TABLE}.' in question and 'SELECT `{COLUMN}` FROM `{TABLE}`' in SQL answer.
If you want to use this, ensure that any table / column can be placed in the designated location and does not affect the plausibility of the question

5, (Optional) You can use {table_name.column_name} to indicate an arbitrary value in this column. 
For example, suggest there is a column student_id in table student. 
When you want to have 'student with id A0001' in question, use 'student with id {student.student_id}'
When you want to have 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == A0001' in SQL answer, use 'WHERE `student`.`student_id` == {student.student_id}'
